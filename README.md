## Location Tracking

This repository implemented

- *Square-root information filter*,
- *Square-root information smoother*,
- *Square-root interacting multiple model (IMM) filter* and
- *Square-root IMM smoother*.

Square-root information filter and smoother are implemented according to the book:

*Bierman, G.J. "Factorization Methods for Discrete Sequential Estimation."
Dover Books on Mathematics Series,
Dover Publications, 2006.*

We developed square-root IMM model filter and smoother based on the classical IMM filter and smoother.
